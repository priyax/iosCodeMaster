// Arithmetic Operators

// We've already seen the assignment operator (=) in action:

var myVar = 42

// In addition to assignment, Swift supports the four standard arithmetic
// operators for all number types:
// Addition (+)
// Subtraction (-)
// Multiplication (*)
// Division (/)

var testVar1 = 1 + 2       // Equals 3
var testVar2 = 5 - 3       // Equals 2
var testVar3 = 2 * 3       // Equals 6
var testVar4 = 10.0 / 2.5  // Equals 4.0

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Compound Assignment Operators

// Like C, Swift provides compound assignment operators that combine assignment
// (=) with another operation. We can use these special assignment operators
// to reduce the amount of code we have to write.

var myNumber = 100
//myNumber = myNumber + 5
myNumber += 5 // Same as saying: myNumber = myNumber + 5

myNumber -= 5 // Same as saying: myNumber = myNumber - 5

myNumber *= 5 // Same as saying: myNumber = myNumber * 5

myNumber /= 5 // Same as saying: myNumber = myNumber / 5

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The addition operator is also supported for Strings. When the addition
// operator is used to join two Strings together it is called, concatenation.

print("Hello, " + "world!")  // Equals the single String, "Hello, world".

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Comparison Operators

// Swift supports all standard C comparison operators:

// Equal to                  (a == b)
// Not equal to              (a != b)
// Greater than              (a > b)
// Less than                 (a < b)
// Greater than or equal to  (a >= b)
// Less than or equal to     (a <= b)

1 == 1   // true, because 1 is equal to 1
2 != 1   // true, because 2 is not equal to 1
2 > 1    // true, because 2 is greater than 1
1 < 2    // true, because 1 is less than 2
1 >= 1   // true, because 1 is greater than or equal to 1
2 <= 1   // false, because 2 is not less than or equal to 1

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Logical Operators

// Logical operators modify or combine the Boolean logic values true and false. 
// Swift supports the three standard logical operators found in C-based languages:
//
// Logical AND (a && b) - Returns true if both expressions are true
// Logical OR  (a || b) - Returns true if either of the two expressions are true
// Logical NOT (!a)     - Negates or inverts the expression's result.

2 > 1 && 4 > 2   // true, because both 2 > 1 AND 4 > 2 are true.

2 > 1 || 0 > 100 // true, because at least one of the expressions is true.

!(1 == 1)        // false because 1 is equal to 1 but the ! inverts the result
                 // and makes it false.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The Remainder Operator

// The remainder operator (a % b) works out how many multiples of b will fit
// inside a and returns the value that is left over (known as the remainder).

// For example, if we divide 9 by 4 we get 2 since at least two 4's can fit into 9
// but what about the remainder?
var quotient = 9 / 4

print("How many 4's can fit into 9: \(quotient)")

// If we want to know just about the remainder we can use the '%' or the remainder
// operator to find out what the remainder is after the 9 is divided by 4.
var remainder = 9 % 4

print("The remainder of dividing 9 by 4 is: \(remainder)")

// While the remainder operator is not used very often in day-to-day coding, it
// often pops in interview questions where you will be asked to identify numbers
// that are the "multiples of some other number", or "divisible by some other number".

// For example, if you're asked to identity all the numbers that are "multiples of three"
// then you could use the remainder operator to find the like so:

15 % 3 == 0 // Is 15 a multiple of 3?

10 % 3 == 0 // Is 10 a multiple of 3?

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Ternary Conditional Operator

// The ternary conditional operator is a special operator with three parts, which
// takes the form of question ? answer1 : answer2.

var speed = 100
var turboButtonPressed = false

speed = (turboButtonPressed ? speed * 2 : speed)

// With out a Ternary Conditional Operator, we would have to write a bit more
// code to get the same result.

speed = 100
turboButtonPressed = true

if turboButtonPressed {
    speed = speed * 2
}
