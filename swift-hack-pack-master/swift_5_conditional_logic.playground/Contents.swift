// We can use if-statements to have our code take some action if some
// condition is true. The most basic control structure is the if-statement.

var health = 0

// If the player's health is less than or equal to 0 - print "You're dead!"
if health <= 0 {
    print( "You're dead!" )
}

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Next, the if-else statement allows us to pick one of two possible actions instead
// of a all-or-nothing choice.

health = 75

// If the player's health is less than or equal to 0 - print "You're dead!"
// Otherwise, print "You're alive!".
if health <= 0 {
    print( "You're dead!" )
} else {
    print( "You're alive!" )
}

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The final form of an if-statement, uses an else-if combination to pick from
// one of several possible actions by chaining two or more if statements
// together.

health = 24

// If the player's health is less than or equal to 0 - print "You're dead!"
// But if the player is not dead, and the player's health is less than 25 -
// print  "You're alive - but badly wounded!" Otherwise, print "You're alive!".
if health <= 0  {
    print( "You're dead!" )

    print( "You're alive - but badly wounded!" )

    print( "You're alive!" )
}

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// If we want to write if-statements that check multiple expressions we can
// use Logical Operators to decided if an if-statement should be executed
// or not.

// Swift Logical Operators

// Logical AND (a && b) - Returns true if both expressions are true
// Logical OR  (a || b) - Returns true if either of the two expressions are true
// Logical NOT (!a)     - Negates or inverts the expression's result.

// If the player has enough gold coins AND the shop keeper has a magic sword
// to sell - ask the player if he would like to purchase it.

if goldCoins >= priceUsingGold && hasSword == true {
    print("Would you like to purchase a magic sword?")
} else {

// ask the player if he would like to purchase it.

if goldCoins >= priceUsingGold || rubies >= priceUsingRubies {
    print("Would you like to purchase a magic sword?")
} else {

// The 'not' Logical Operator just inverts or negates a Boolean variable or the
// result of an expression.

// A switch statement provides an alternative to the if statement when we need
// to compare a value against several possible matches.
